# Cookie-Clicker-Assignment

Week 3 Assignment to build a basic cookie clicker game
🎯 Draw a wireframe including the main game sections, refer to the demo for inspiration
🎯 Build out the wireframe using your knowledge of HTML and CSS.
🎯 Style the button. Draw a cookie, use stock assets, or use a giant emoji! 🍪
🎯 Add an event listener to the button to increment a cookie counter variable.

<!-- 🏹 Add a CSS animation of some kind when you click the button -->

🎯 Select the HTML element for the cookie total and update it's contents so the cookie counter starts to increment on the page
🎯 Use localStorage to store the cookie count value on every increment, and load it again when the app runs on page load
🎯 Make a call to the cookie's API to get your list of upgrades back.
🎯Add an event listener to each upgrade button that checks if the user has enough cookies to buy it, and if so, subtracts the cost from the cookie count, and tracks the purchased items and their increment bonus.
🎯Use the owned items and their increment bonus to calculate the total increment value to add every second or every click
