# Cookie-Clicker-Assignment

Week 3 Assignment to build a basic cookie clicker game

🎯 Draw a wireframe including the main game sections, refer to the demo for inspiration

🎯 Build out the wireframe using your knowledge of HTML and CSS.

🎯 Style the button. Draw a cookie, use stock assets, or use a giant emoji! 🍪

🎯 Add an event listener to the button to increment a cookie counter variable.

<!-- 🏹 Add a CSS animation of some kind when you click the button -->

🎯 Select the HTML element for the cookie total and update it's contents so the cookie counter starts to increment on the page
🎯 Use localStorage to store the cookie count value on every increment, and load it again when the app runs on page load
🎯 Make a call to the cookie's API to get your list of upgrades back.
🎯Add an event listener to each upgrade button that checks if the user has enough cookies to buy it, and if so, subtracts the cost from the cookie count, and tracks the purchased items and their increment bonus.
🎯Use the owned items and their increment bonus to calculate the total increment value to add every second or every click

# My Reflection

I believe I made all the basic requirements for this assignment. I struggled with getting into the array from the api in order to be able to append it to my page. I also struggled with the local storage, I was ok with getting it to save into local storage but I struggled with being able to stop it deleting after I refreshed the page, with some help from other members in our group I managed to sort this out. I had a problem with how my elements where positioned on the page once uploaded to git hub, although it looked fine on my vscode it was all overlapping on git hub but I spent some time on media queries to be able sort this out.

I did alot of back and forth with reading through demo's and the workshops to write all my code, the one thing I have learned is I need to plan everything out alot more to be able to know what code to start writing first so I have a better understanding of what all my code is doing. I would like some feedback on how better to achieve this as I feel this would help me understand the languages easier as well.

overall I did struggle with this assignment but it has shown me that I am learning alot and hopefully over the coming weeks i'll be able to build on this and understand everything alot more. I do appreciate being able to get help from other group members as without this I wouldn't have got as far as I have done but with their help I am learning alot about where Im going wrong and how to improve.
